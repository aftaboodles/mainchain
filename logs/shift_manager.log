npm WARN deprecated bower@1.7.9: ..psst! While Bower is maintained, we recommend Yarn and Webpack for *new* front-end projects! Yarn's advantage is security and reliability, and Webpack's is support for both CommonJS and AMD projects. Currently there's no migration path, but please help to create it: https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/2467
